    <p>Capricorns fit into the star sign dates between December 22nd and January 20th, and belong to the Earth element of the zodiac (along with Taurus and Virgo - who they happen to be incredibly compatible with, romantically). The Earth sign crew are all practical, self reliant, stoic and ambitious. You'd want them in your corner... but maybe not at a party.</p>
    <p>Capricorns are the hardest workers of the zodiac and love nothing more than getting ahead in life. They are ambitious, determined, materialistic and strong. They will keep going when others would've given up ten miles back. This makes them great partners in life, as well as friends or collaborators. </p>
    <p>Capricorns tend to keep small circles, but are loyal and supportive of their friends and loved ones. They love creating secure, luxurious ~nests~ and living a comfortable, enviable lifestyle. Living well is important to them. Capricorns are born shrewd, they ~get~ what makes others tick, and they are self-aware of their own needs and traits too. Caps are good people! </p>
