    <p>As the humanitarian of the zodiac, this sign does have a bit of a reputation for being cold, aloof, and somewhat detached. Here's the thing: Aquarius hates small talk. Aquarius is totally disinterested in petty gossip and, frankly, could care less about people-please niceties. This zodiac sign is committed to creating a large-scale impact from the ground up, which means these revolutionaries are all about macro change. Aquarius aspires to move the needle through radical social progress, so if they seem disinterested, it's likely because the issue at hand isn't community-focused. Shifting the conversation from "me" to "we" (as in, the collective) will absolutely pique Aquarius' interest!</p>
    <p>Every Aquarian is a rebel at heart: These air signs don't mesh well with authority-figures, let alone any institution that represents tradition and long-standing convention. Free-spirited and eccentric, you can often spot this air sign through their offbeat fashion sensibilities, unusual hobbies, and nonconformist attitude. If you're an Aquarius yourself, keep in mind that solar and lunar eclipses can have large-scale impact, so be sure to look out for these major astrological milestones. While you're at it, go ahead and dig deeper on your Aquarius horoscope â€” there's always more to uncover!</p>
